Enhanced Alert Generation System with Attacker IP for DOS Attacks

ðŸ“š Project Overview
The Enhanced Alert Generation System with Attacker IP for DoS Attacks is a real-time network monitoring system designed to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. It identifies potential malicious activity based on packet thresholds, captures the attacker's IP address, and sends real-time email alerts to the network administrator. This system ensures prompt action against network threats while maintaining network performance integrity.
